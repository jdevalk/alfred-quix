# Quix AlfredApp workflow
An Alfred workflow to quickly perform numerous checks on websites.

This workflow pretty much works straight ouf the box!

It comes with 3 built-in commands:

- Quix itself, which I always open with `Alt+Q` or by typing `quix`
- Site search, which I always open with `Cmd+Alt+S`, or by typing `site-search`
- Whois, opened by typing `whois`
