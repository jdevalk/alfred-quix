# Quix AlfredApp workflow

<img src="icon.png" alt="Quix logo" align="right" width="150" height="150">

An [AlfredApp](https://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow to quickly perform numerous checks on websites.

This workflow pretty much works straight ouf the box, as soon as you **assign the hotkeys**!

It comes with 3 built-in commands:

- Quix itself, which I always open with `Alt+Q` or by typing `quix`
- Site search, which I always open with `Cmd+Alt+S`, or by typing `site-search`
- Whois, opened by typing `whois` in Quix, or as a command when you open Quix, so you can use it for the current domain you're looking at.

## How to install

Download the [`Quix.alfredworkflow`](https://github.com/jdevalk/alfred-quix/raw/main/Quix.alfredworkflow) file and double click to install it.
